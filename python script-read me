pip install gitpython docker paramiko requests

Explanation
Clone a GitHub Repository: The script first checks if the repository already exists locally. If it does, it pulls the latest changes. If not, it clones the repository.
Build and Push Docker Image: The script builds a Docker image from the Dockerfile located in the cloned repository directory and then pushes this image to Docker Hub.
Deploy Docker Container via SSH: Using paramiko, the script connects to a remote server via SSH and executes a series of commands to pull the latest Docker image and deploy it as a container.
Monitor Deployment: The script continuously monitors the service by checking a health check URL at specified intervals.
Customization
Configuration Variables: Replace the placeholder values in the configuration section with your actual values.
Commands: Adjust the DEPLOY_COMMANDS list based on your deployment steps.
